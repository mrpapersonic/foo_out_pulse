this contains files to build a pulseaudio-wrapper layer for the foo_out_pulse
binary.

to compile it, simply run
```
winegcc -o pulseaudio-wrapper.dll.so -shared pulseaudio-wrapper.c \
	pulseaudio-wrapper.spec -I(location of pulse headers) \
	-L(location of pulse library) -lpulse
```
in your shell of choice. you (obviously) need winelib and winegcc,
as well as development headers for pulseaudio.
